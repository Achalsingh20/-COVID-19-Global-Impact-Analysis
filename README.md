# COVID-19 Tableau Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard visualizing key insights related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The dashboard leverages data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive analysis.

## Data Sources
- **CovidDeaths.xlsx**: Contains records of COVID-19-related fatalities, infection rates, and other statistics.
- **CovidVaccinations.xlsx**: Provides information on vaccine distribution and administration across different regions.
- **Tableau Joins File.xlsx**: Combines multiple datasets for better correlation and visualization.

## Key Features
- **Global COVID-19 Death Trends**: Track the cumulative and daily reported deaths by country and region.
- **COVID-19 Cases Over Time**: Visualize confirmed cases with time-series analysis and heatmaps.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Analyze vaccination rollouts, fully vaccinated individuals, and vaccine distribution by country.
- **Mortality and Recovery Rates**: Compare death vs. recovery rates using pie charts and bar charts.
- **Regional Analysis**: Identify high-risk areas and analyze the impact across different regions.

## Insights from the Dashboard
- Countries with high population density tend to have higher infection rates.
- Vaccination rollouts strongly correlate with declining mortality rates.
- Some regions still have low vaccination rates, indicating the need for increased distribution efforts.
- The death rate fluctuates based on healthcare system capacity and government interventions.

## How to Use
1. Open the Tableau dashboard file (`Covid Dashboard.twbx`) in Tableau Desktop.
2. Interact with the different visualizations to explore data trends.
3. Use filters to focus on specific regions, time periods, or data categories.

## Conclusion
This Tableau dashboard provides a data-driven approach to understanding COVID-19â€™s impact globally. The visualizations assist policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in making informed decisions about containment, vaccination strategies, and resource allocation.
